# FWD-Projects
This repository contains all the basic projects I completed during my semester in Fundamental Web Development. It includes HTML and CSS fundamentals such as webpage structure, forms, layouts, styling, and responsive design. These projects reflect my hands-on practice and growing understanding of front-end development concepts.
